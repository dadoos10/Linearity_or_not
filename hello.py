# Rona's Project:
# In this project we research the linearity relationship between biological components to quantitative MRI (qMRI).
# it is well known (source!) that lypid and iron represent linear connection to qMRI parameters, seperatly. 
# Here we want to ask if the combination of the two types represent linearity as well.
# the players: 
# biological components: lipids: PC,PC_SphingoMyalin.....
# qMRI parameters: R1,R2s,MT,MTV.  
# import pandas as pd
# import NumPy as np
# first we want to crate a scan rescan plot, to see the stability of our experimants.
# Actualy we make two plots, one for iron, one for lipyd, since they behave different.
